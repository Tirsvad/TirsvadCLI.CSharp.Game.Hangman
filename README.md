# Hangman

This is a simple hangman game that I craeted in CSharp. The game is played in the console and the user has to guess the word that the computer has chosen. The user has 6 lives and if they run out of lives, they lose the game. The user can also guess the whole word at once. If the user guesses the word correctly, they win the game.

It is in development and not playable yet.
